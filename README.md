# 🧨 Diffusion-Scheduled Denoising Autoencoders for Anomaly Detection (AnoDDAE)

**Official implementation of the method presented in our KDD 2025 paper:** 

> **Diffusion-Scheduled Denoising Autoencoders for Anomaly Detection in Tabular Data** [Link]() (appears soon)

This repository provides reproducible implementation of the anomaly detection method based on a denoising autoencoder architecture with diffusion noise scheduling mechanism inspired by diffusion models.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This repository focuses on the methodology only. No pretrained models are released.

## 🌐 Project Overview

Our method improves anomaly detection in tabular data by:

1. **Methodology:** Introduction of the diffusion-scheduled denoising autoencoder (DDAE) that integrates diffusion noise scheduling into the denoising autoencoder framework.
2. **Representation:** Extension of DDAE using a contrastive learning objective (DDAE-C) that improves tabular data representations and anomaly detection performance.
3. **Evaluation**: Comprehensive evaluation of DDAE and DDAE-C, demonstrating their effectiveness in semi-supervised and unsupervised anomaly detection settings.
4. **Analysis**: In-depth analysis of the scheduled noise addition process, examining its impact on anomaly detection erformance across multiple noise protocols.
